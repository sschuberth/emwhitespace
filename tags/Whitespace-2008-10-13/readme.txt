EmEditor Whitespace Plug-in
---------------------------

This plug-in offers a more complete alternative to the "ShowReturns" and "Trim
Right" plug-ins. When its icon is selected from the plug-in toolbar, a pop-up
menu is displayed offering to:

    - Directly enable / disable the display of whitespace characters:

        * Line-Ends
        * End of File
        * Tabs
        * Spaces

    - Ensure final Line-End on Save (only for EmEditor 8.00 and above)

    - Convert leading Spaces to Tabs (Tabify)

    - Convert Tabs to Spaces (Untabify)

    - Trim Trailing Whitespaces

All the conversion commands work on the current selection, or the whole document
if there is no selection. In this they differ from the built-in commands
available from the "Edit" main menu.

The "pilcrow" icon was taken from the Silk Icon Set 1.3 freely available at
